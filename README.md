# RandomForestsCapstone

Code for my undergraduate Capstone paper, "Random Forests for Supervised Classification." This paper is part of the senior capstone project for my Mathematics major at Kenyon College. For context, this is not a research paper, nor an exhaustive overview of random forests; instead, it's meant to be a thorough introduction to a topic beyond our coursework that is approachable to our peers (other math majors at Kenyon).

The code is provided here for transparency as to how I arrived at the results and figures presented in the paper. Be warned -- the Python script is more like a collection of code snippets than one coherent script. As a final note, it appears the grid search results are not exactly reproducible with the default options (as I've written it). For this reason, these results may differ slightly from what appear in the paper.
